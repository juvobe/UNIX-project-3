# UNIX-project-3
Käyttöjärjestelmät ja systeemiohjelmointi course project 3 UNIX shell.

As the third project I created the UNIX shell program. Everything in the code works as instructed and the code should be well enough commented.
All the built-in commands are separately implemented, general commands work when they’re found in the path, parallel command execution and redirection also work as instructed.
A fair amount of help was required for this program, and all used sources are commented in the code in relevant locations where they were used.
